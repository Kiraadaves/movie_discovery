## Movie Web App

I created this app as part of my internship requirement with Hngx. It was created using [React.js](https://react.dev), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

## Getting Started

To create the react app, i followed the following steps:

```bash
npm init react-app movie
cd movie
# movie is the name I chose for the app
npm start
```

The browser automatically opens [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) after which I started building by creating components, pages and also editing `App/index.js`.

I also made use of various dependencies like [React/router](https://reactrouter.com) for this project.
I also made use of [MaterialUI/Material icons](https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/)

## Deployment

After making my final changes and pushing to github, I deployed my app via the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com).
